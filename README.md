# ActivityAndStudents
Project repo for Data Science course "Studies on Human Behaviour" in Trento. 
While moving from a purely Sociological setting to a Data Science one, we the authors, study the behaviour of active students in this project, using Big amounts of data collected in November - December 2020 from the "WeNet" project. Data won't be provided unless it was allowed according to the WeNet team. 

This project strives for knowledge on how students live their lives in regard to sport and physical activity in Trento. Even during the (then) ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, students exercised for wellbeing. 
The results are reported in a small paper.
