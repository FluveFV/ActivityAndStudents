# ActivityAndStudents
Project repo for Data Science course "Studies on Human Behaviour" in Trento. 
While moving from a purely Sociological setting to a Data Science one, we the authors, study the behaviour of active students in this project, using Big amounts of data collected in November - December 2020 from the *"WeNet"* project. Data won't be provided unless it was allowed according to the WeNet team. 

This project strives for **knowledge on how students live their lives in regard to sport and physical activity in Trento**. Even during the (then) ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, students exercised for wellbeing. 
The results are reported in a small paper.
