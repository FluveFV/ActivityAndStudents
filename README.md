# ActivityAndStudents
Research project repository for Data Science course "Studies on Human Behaviour" in Trento. 
While moving from a purely Sociological setting to a Data Science one, we the authors, study the behaviour of active students in this project, using Big amounts of data collected in November - December 2020 from the **"WeNet"** project. Data won't be provided unless it was allowed according to the WeNet team. 

This project strives for **knowledge on how students live their lives in regard to sport and physical activity in Trento**. Even during the (then) ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, students exercised for wellbeing. 

This research project is supposed to be reproducible and trustworthy. In order for it to work, you need to be granted permission from WeNet to obtain the data that you will put in the "data" folder. The data we used is: time diary, data for time diary (socio-demographic and psychological attributes), step sensor. 

Steps:

0.5 - Check your modules version using the specified packages in "requirements.txt"

1 - Run "Processing and cleaning data" notebook first. 

2 - You can now run any other notebook to obtain different sections of the paper. Each notebook has a specific analysis purpose.
